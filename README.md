# 0x1D. C - Binary Trees

This repository contains solutions and implementations related to binary trees in the C programming language. Binary trees are a fundamental data structure in computer science used to organize data efficiently.

## Overview

Binary trees are hierarchical data structures composed of nodes, where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. They are widely used in various algorithms and applications due to their versatility and efficiency.

In this repository, you will find:

- **Implementation of Binary Trees**: C code that demonstrates the creation, traversal, insertion, deletion, and other operations on binary trees.
- **Binary Tree Algorithms**: Solutions to common problems and algorithms related to binary trees, such as finding the height, determining if a tree is balanced, finding the lowest common ancestor, etc.
- **Documentation**: Detailed explanations and documentation regarding the implementations and algorithms employed.

## Contents

- **src/**: This directory contains the source code for the binary tree implementations and algorithms.
- **include/**: Header files necessary for the binary tree implementations.
- **docs/**: Documentation files providing insights into the codebase, algorithms, and usage.
- **examples/**: Example programs demonstrating the usage of binary trees for various tasks.
